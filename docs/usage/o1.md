# o1 API Support

If you are already whitelisted for the o1 API, you can use it by specifying the model with the `-m` flag. You must also
provide the `--stream=false` flag to not stream the output as it is not supported by the o1 API (this is only necessary,
if you have provided the stream option via the config file).

Example:

```shell
$ sgpt -m "o1-preview" --stream=false "how many rs are in strawberry?"
There are three "r"s in the word "strawberry".
```

You can also create a bash alias to use the o1 API more easily. For example, add the following line to your `.bashrc`:

```shell
alias sgpt-o1="sgpt -m \"o1-preview\" --stream=false"
```

Then you can use the alias like this:

```shell
$ sgpt-o1 "how many rs are in strawberry?"
There are three "r"s in the word "strawberry".
```

**Important:** The o1 API does not support [personas](personas.md).
